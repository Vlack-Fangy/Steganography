## Tech Stack
- **Python:** The project is built using Python, leveraging the power of its versatile libraries.
- **Tkinter:** For the user-friendly graphical interface.
- **PIL (Pillow):** Used for image processing and manipulation.
- **io, os:** Essential for handling input/output operations.

## Overview
Ever wondered about hiding data in plain sight? That's exactly what our Image Stagenography project does! This project allows you to seamlessly encode and decode messages within images. The concept is simple yet fascinating - your data remains incognito, right within your images.
## How it Works

1. **Encode:** Select an image, input your text, and witness the magic as your message gets subtly embedded into the image of your choice.
2. **Decode:** Retrieve hidden messages by uploading an image containing encoded data. Uncover the concealed information effortlessly!

## Project Flow
The project is structured with a user-friendly interface, making it easy for anyone to explore. It consists of two main functionalities:
- **Encode:** Hide your message within an image of your choosing.

## Code Walkthrough
The code is neatly organized into classes and functions, ensuring modularity and readability. The graphical interface is implemented using Tkinter, providing an interactive experience. Image processing is handled using the Pillow library, making it a powerful tool for stagenography.

## Future Applications
Stagenography holds immense potential in various fields, including:
- **Data Security:** Concealing sensitive information within images adds an extra layer of security.
- **Communication:** Covert communication and sharing of confidential data.
- **Data Science:** Exploring creative ways to embed metadata within images.

Feel free to dive into the code and unleash the possibilities of stagenography in your own projects!

Happy Stagenographing! üåêüîí
